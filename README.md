# RL Playground

This repo contains implementations of multiple RL algorithms. Mostly simple versions used for my practice purposes to brush up my RL basics and also some prototypes of RL applications in ad recommendation. The `notebooks/` directory contains jupyter notebooks with documentation along with the code.
